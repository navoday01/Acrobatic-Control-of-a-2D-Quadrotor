# Acrobatic-Control-of-a-2D-Quadrotor
Acrobatic control of a 2D quadrotor refers to the ability of the quadrotor to perform complex, dynamic maneuvers such as flips and turns. In this project, we designed and implemented two controllers for a 2D quadrotor to enable it to perform acrobatic maneuvers: a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller and an iterative LQR (iLQR) controller with added line search. The LQR controller was designed to maintain a predefined position and follow a predefined trajectory, while the iLQR controller was developed to perform acrobatic maneuvers and avoid local minima.
